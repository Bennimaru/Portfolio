            <p>My previous occupation was that of an enrollment coordinator in an managed long term care health insurance company. I'm proud of the success that the department and I achieved during my time there. However I wasn't getting the intellectual stimulation I wanted and I knew I needed to make a change. I joined The Knowledge House in partnership with the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline back in April of 2018 and thus started my journey into code.</p>
