				<h1>Benson Yu</h1>
				<p>
					My journey into code started back in April of 2018 when I joined The
					Knowledge House in partnership with the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline.
					After learning some basic web development at TKH, I wanted to
					accelerate my career change process by enrolling into a coding
					bootcamp. After exploring my options, I chose to enroll into Flatiron
					School's Software Engineering Immersive Program. The culture and
					curriculum was a transformative experience. I developed skills in
					Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL and furthered my previous Javascript
					knowledge via the framework React with Redux. After graduating from
					Flatiron School, I got my start as a Software Engineering Intern at
					Sharebite. While there I learned about testing with Jest and Puppeteer
					and served in a quality assurance role. After parting ways, I'm
					looking forward to continuing my coding journey and whatever
					challenges it will bring. Currently dabbling in python and Microsoft
					Azure.
