      <h1>Benson Yu</h1>
      <p>
        My journey into code started back in April of 2018 when I joined The
        Knowledge House in partnership with the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline. My
        previous occupation was that of an enrollment coordinator in an managed
        long term care health insurance company. I'm proud of the success that
        the department and I achieved during my time there. However I wasn't
        getting the intellectual stimulation I wanted and I knew I needed to
        make a change. After learning some basic web development at TKH, I
        wanted to dive even deeper down the rabbit hole and decided to enroll
        into a coding bootcamp. After exploring my options and applying to
        several different bootcamps, I got accepted into Flatiron School's
        Software Engineering Immersive Program.
